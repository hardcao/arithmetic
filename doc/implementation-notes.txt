Implementation Notes for Arithmetic
===================================

The HTML5 code that defines this simulation was originally written by an outside contractor, then taken over by PhET.
Some elements of the code from the contractor were structured a bit differently than they would have been had they been
implemented by PhET from the outset.  Some of the code, such as the nature of the state transitions, was rewritten in
order to make it more maintainable and extensible.  Other portions were left as they were in the interests of getting
the sim published in a timely manner.  As a result, the code is probably going to look a bit odd to anyone coming along
to maintain this some years in the future, since there were two very different ideas of what constitutes good MVC-
oriented software design, and good software design in general, in the minds of the two primary authors of this code.
Keeping this in mind may help when working to decipher what lies within.

Note to self (jblanco) - the items below this line have been added as I thought of them, and should be edited into a
coherent narrative before this simulation is first published.

Terminology: The sim uses the terms multiplicand, multiplier, and product when referring to an equation.  This seems to
be the common terminology used based on what was seen when researching this on line.  As an example, for the equation
4 * 5 = 20, 4 is the multiplicand, 5 is the multiplier, and 20 is the product.

There is no model element corresponding to an individual cell.  Instead, there are simply arrays that track whether a
given cell is used or not, and there is a built-in assumption that the cells correspond to the appropriate position
in a square multiplication table.  An alternative approach would have been to have each cell exist in the model, and
have a property that indicates whether it should be shown in the table.  I (jblanco) believe that the original
developer did what he did because of concerns about the performance impact of creating so many properties and then
linking them to an attribute that controlled the visibility.  This also means that all the color changes done to the
cells as they are selected/deslected are done strictly in the view, not in the model.  Again, this was probably done
for performance reasons, but it may be a little surprising to any would be maintainers of this sim.

The model just tracks whether a cell is used, size of table.

There seems to have been a number of things done in anticipation of performance issues, and these have made the code a
bit harder to read.

It's weird that the tables are actually three tables.  Why not do them separately, and have the parent class switch
them in and out based on the level?
