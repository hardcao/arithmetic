Implementation Notes for Arithmetic
===================================

The HTML5 code that defines this simulation was originally written by an outside contractor, then taken over by PhET.
Some elements of the code from the contractor were structured a bit differently than they would have been had they been
implemented by PhET from the outset.  Some of the code, such as the nature of the state transitions, was rewritten in
order to make it more maintainable and extensible.  Other portions were left as they were in the interests of getting
the sim published in a timely manner.  As a result, the code is probably going to look a bit odd to anyone coming along
to maintain this some years in the future, since there were two very different ideas of what constitutes good MVC-
oriented software design, and good software design in general, in the minds of the two primary authors of this code.
Keeping this in mind may help when working to decipher what lies within.

Terminology: The sim uses the terms multiplicand, multiplier, and product when referring to an equation.  This seems to
be the common terminology used based on what was seen when researching this on line.  For the equation 4 * 5 = 20, 4 is
the multiplicand, 5 is the multiplier, and 20 is the product.
