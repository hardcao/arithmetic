Implementation Notes for Arithmetic
===================================

Here be Dragons

The HTML5 code that defines this simulation was originally written by a
contractor, then taken over by PhET.  The code from the contractor was, in
this author's opinion, oddly structured.  I tried, I really did, to get it,
to understand why certain design choices were made, and to roll with it.  In
the end, however, some major restructuring was done in order to support the
addition of new features.  As a result, the code is probably going to look a
bit odd to anyone coming along to maintain this some years in the future,
since I feel like there were two very different ideas of what constitutes good
MVC-oriented software design, and good software design in general, in the
minds of the two authors of this code.  Keeping this in mind may help when
working to decipher what lies within.
